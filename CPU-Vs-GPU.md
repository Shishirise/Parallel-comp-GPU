# CPU vs GPU: A Comparison

---

## 📦 Key Differences (Side by Side)

| Feature              | CPU (Central Processing Unit)                           | GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cores**            | Few (4–64 strong cores)                                 | Thousands of smaller CUDA/Shader cores                 |
| **Task Type**        | Sequential, general-purpose                             | Parallel, specialized for math-heavy workloads         |
| **Strength**         | Complex logic, branching, OS tasks                      | Massive floating-point math, matrix/vector operations  |
| **Memory**           | Large cache, optimized for latency                      | High-bandwidth VRAM, optimized for throughput          |
| **Clock Speed**      | High (3–5 GHz typical)                                  | Lower (~1–2 GHz) but compensated by massive parallelism |
| **Instruction Model**| MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)              | SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) via warps      |
| **Power Efficiency** | Efficient for small tasks                               | Efficient for large, parallel tasks                    |
| **Programming**      | C, C++, Java, Python                                    | CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan, DirectX                          |

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

### CPU:
- Running operating systems  
- Word processing, web browsing  
- Handling logic-heavy code (databases, system tasks)  
- Example: Your laptop’s CPU controls **Windows/macOS** and runs **MS Word**  

### GPU:
- 3D Graphics rendering in games (textures, lighting, physics)  
- AI/ML model training (deep learning, neural networks)  
- Video editing & transcoding (4K/8K rendering)  
- Example: **NVIDIA RTX GPUs** train ChatGPT models or render graphics in **AAA games**
